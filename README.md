## What is Apache Kafka:
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to build real-time pipelines and can be used as a message broker or as a replacement for a log aggregation solution for big data applications.

## Prerequisites:
- Go
- Docker
- Docker Compose (Usually, it's installed within Docker)

In this project, I created a docker-compose file to run Apache Kafka as a container.
